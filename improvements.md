# Repository Improvement Checklist

- [✅] **Create a root `README.md`:** Write a `README.md` file in the root of the project that explains the purpose and structure of this repository, including a tree structure.
- [✅] **Standardize directory structure:** Ensure each course has a consistent directory structure (e.g., `Lectures`, `Exercises`, `Examples`, `Quizzes`).
- [ ] **Add course `README.md` files:** Add a `README.md` to each course directory to provide an overview of the course content, including metadata like codes and prerequisites.
- [ ] **Create a `.gitignore` file:** Add a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from the repository (e.g., build artifacts, temporary files).
- [ ] **Add compilation/execution instructions:** For programming courses, include instructions on how to compile and run the code examples (only if non-obvious).
- [ ] **Review and complete `README.md` files:** Go through all `README.md` files to ensure they are complete and up-to-date, including accuracy and cross-references.
- [ ] **Add a `LICENSE` file:** Add a `LICENSE` file (e.g., MIT) to define the permissions for others, and consider adding licenses to sub-projects if intended for separate use.
- [✅] **Organize semesters into years:** Create `Year_1`, `Year_2`, etc. directories and move the corresponding `Semester_*` directories inside them.
- [ ] **Add repository description and topics on GitHub:** Add a description and tags/topics to the repository.
- [ ] **Fix naming inconsistencies:** Address any inconsistencies, such as in Electronics examples.
- [ ] **Add Applications directory README:** Create a README for the Applications directory.
- [ ] **Add resource recommendations:** Include recommendations for related courses and resources.
