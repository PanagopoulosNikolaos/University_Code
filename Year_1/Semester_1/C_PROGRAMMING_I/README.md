# C Programming I

## Course Overview
This course provides an introduction to the C programming language, covering fundamental concepts such as variables, data types, control flow, functions, and arrays. It is designed for beginners with no prior programming experience.

## Course Code
CPE 101

## Prerequisites
None

This directory contains a series of C programs that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts. Each file is a standalone program that can be compiled and run to see the concept in action.

## Files

The files are numbered in a suggested learning order:

1.  `01_hello_world.c`: A simple "Hello, World!" program to get you started.
2.  `02_variables_and_data_types.c`: Demonstrates how to declare and use variables of different data types.
3.  `03_basic_input_output.c`: Shows how to get input from the user and print output to the console.
4.  `04_arithmetic_operators.c`: Covers the basic arithmetic operators in C.
5.  `05_control_flow_if_else.c`: Demonstrates how to use `if` and `else` statements to control the flow of your program.
6.  `06_control_flow_switch.c`: Shows how to use `switch` statements for multi-way branching.
7.  `07_loops_for.c`: Covers `for` loops for iterating a specific number of times.
8.  `08_loops_while.c`: Demonstrates `while` loops for iterating as long as a condition is true.
9.  `09_loops_do_while.c`: Shows how to use `do-while` loops, which always execute at least once.
10. `10_functions.c`: Covers how to define and call functions.
11. `11_arrays.c`: Demonstrates how to declare, initialize, and use arrays.
12. `12_strings.c`: Shows how to work with strings in C.
13. `13_pointers.c`: Covers the basics of pointers.
14. `14_functions_and_pointers.c`: Demonstrates how to use pointers with functions.
15. `15_structures.c`: Shows how to create and use structures to group related data.
16. `16_unions.c`: Covers unions, which allow you to store different data types in the same memory location.
17. `17_file_handling_write.c`: Demonstrates how to write to a file.
18. `18_file_handling_read.c`: Shows how to read from a file.
19. `19_preprocessor_directives.c`: Covers preprocessor directives like `#include` and `#define`.
20. `20_ctype_library.c`: Demonstrates how to use the `ctype` library for character manipulation.

## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run these programs, you will need a C compiler like GCC. You can compile a program from the terminal like this:

```bash
gcc 01_hello_world.c -o hello_world
```

This will create an executable file named `hello_world`. You can then run the program like this:

```bash
./hello_world
```
